# kubectl-mirror

kubectl mirror is a tool that allows you to mirror a specific pod along with its network traffic. This functionality enables you to replicate the behavior of a pod, capturing its network interactions, for troubleshooting, monitoring, or testing purposes. It provides an easy way to observe how a pod functions in different environments without directly impacting the original pod.
